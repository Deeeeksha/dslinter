      <title>Vectorized Solution Unused</title>

      <description>Description &amp;ldquo;Vectorization is the process of converting an algorithm from operating on a single value at a time to operating on a set of values (vector) at one time.&amp;rdquo; ML applications are often data-intensive and need to apply an operation on a dataset. Therefore, it is better to adopt vectorized solution instead of iterating over data. As stated in the Pandas documentation : ”Iterating through pandas objects is generally slow. In many cases, iterating manually over the rows is not needed and can be avoided”.</description>

      <title>No Scaling Before Scaling Sensitive Operation</title>

      <description>Description Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is used for finding the components that maximize the data&amp;rsquo;s variation and reduce its dimensions, which is an essential data processing method. Scaling is pretty crucial to PCA because of the way the principal components are calculated. If one variable is on a larger scale than another, it will dominate the PCA procedure. Similarly, there are some other scaling-sensitive operations. Support Vector Machine (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Multi-layer Perceptron classifier, L1 and L2 regularization are all sensitive to feature scaling.</description>

      <title>Chain Indexing Misused</title>

      <description>Description Chaining indexing in Pandas is considered a bad practice and should be avoided. Using chain indexing might cause performance issues as well as prone-to-bug code. For example, when using df[&amp;quot;one&amp;quot;][&amp;quot;two&amp;quot;], Pandas see this operation as two events: call df[&amp;quot;one&amp;quot;] first and call [&amp;quot;two&amp;quot;] based on the result the previous operation gets. On the contrary, df.loc[:,(&amp;quot;one&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;two&amp;quot;)] only perform a single call. In this way, the second method can be significantly faster than the first one.</description>

      <description>Description When using pd.eval() in Pandas library, the numexpr is optimized for performance and python options offer no performance benefit over numexpr. Generally, it is not recommended to set the parameter to python. The developers should be careful when explicitly set this parameter.
